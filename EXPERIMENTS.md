## Whole-peer baselines

These exact peer commits were evaluated locally on the same 15 public games. A high Private score need not beat this bot on the public batch.

## Reviewed experiment notes

Reviewed 27 September 2026. These notes summarize completed attempts through 8;
the automatically generated history table is authoritative for newer decisions.
This is experiment context, not a required new mutation or a measured gain.

## Keep the successful mechanism narrow

Attempt 7 added only a `GlobalLogic.can_sacrify()` guard against cockatrice and
chickatrice corpse selection without gloves. Full Public: 0.2597258454 parent
to 0.2861614452 candidate, two improvements and thirteen score ties. Fresh three
games tied at 0.4086152658, so the candidate was promoted. Preserve this guard.
It prevents a deliberate sacrifice pickup route; it is not general protection
against live petrifying monsters or every floor inspection.

## Preliminary failures omitted from the short history table

These changes were tested and reverted. Revisit only with a materially different
mechanism supported by new evidence, not merely a different favorable subset.

- Unconditional early digging-tool retention showed no gain in attempts 5 and 6.
- Quiet recovery below 80% HP before diving was mixed and regressed several
  strong games (attempt 5). Broad passive-contact avoidance lost on the full
  Public batch (attempt 3).
- Blanket earlier dive thresholds were unreliable: XL9 lost on full15 in
  attempt 6 despite a good three-game sample. XL8 also regressed. Attempt 7's
  25,000-turn/XL8 exit gained on 3/7/13 but regressed 2/4/8; a 10,000-turn/XL5
  first-level exit also had a larger regression than its gain.
- Permitting injured Valkyries to melee cold-passive jellies/molds and treating
  every species of difficulty >=8 as dangerous regressed samples (attempt 7).
- Enabling existing Elbereth recovery during the tour initially helped seed 3
  but regressed strong games in the broader nine-game sample (attempt 7).
- Exact critical-HP prayer eligibility did not improve samples 0/3/6 and
  1/7/13 in attempt 7. Do not claim it is untested.
- Broad remembered-petrifying-corpse BFS exclusion lost on full15 (attempt 5).
  Skipping all floor inspection on those squares also regressed stronger games
  (attempt 7). Blind-only inspection suppression and a guard only on the
  inspection PICKUP fallback did not improve 7/2/12. These differ from the
  successful sacrifice-selector guard above.

## Tactical lookahead: implemented, no measured Public improvement

Attempt 8 completed the requested three-turn planner and published it, but
candidate and same-run parent both scored 0.2893345546. Every full15 per-game
result field matched except wall time. No fresh validation or promotion followed.
The saved 0.2861614452 champion score from another run is not the right control
for claiming this planner improved anything.

The model and adapter were unchanged from the supplied assets. The mutator fixed
two integration defects: production StatsLogger requires explicit registration
of lookahead_plan/lookahead_override/lookahead_unsupported, and the default
TACTICAL_LOOKAHEAD flag must precede JF_CFG environment overrides. The original
fake-logger fixture missed the first defect. Production logger plus real fight2
fixtures now demonstrate an override can execute on a constructed observation.

Saved arena results contain no planner counters or action traces. Actual-game
planning and override counts remain unverified. A sample depth change that did
not persist in full15 does not prove activation. Before interpreting a further
planner variant, obtain bounded direct activation/fallback/override diagnostics;
do not broaden its safety gates merely to manufacture activity. The model
estimates hidden HP/damage/energy rather than cloning exact future game states.

## Evaluation discipline

Same-source reruns have varied. Inspected seed derivation uses secret,
evaluation ID and trajectory ID, not solution digest or EXPERIMENTS.md. The
cause of variation remains unproven. Compare with the same-run full Public
parent and retain fresh local validation. Small samples and death labels alone
do not establish causal improvement. Public publication and organizer Private
scores are separate from local champion promotion.

## Visible-pet gas-spore guard (local, val-dwa-law-fem)

Hypothesis: avoid shooting a gas spore beside a visible pet to prevent blast kills
that damage alignment and disable survival prayers. Enabled only the existing
ranged gas-spore pet guard, independently of HAZARD_FIXES. Peer 3's pinned
`vkurenkov/nethacker@ef6acf87e265f74600b914060f620d06117070a3` supported
this mechanism; its broader remembered-pet and peaceful-monster guards were not
adopted. The source is already recorded in the solution manifest; MIT license retained.

All evaluations used evaluation-id `local`.

| Seed | Parent | Candidate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0.074536 | 0.425836 |
| 1 | 0.024160 | 0.036888 |
| 2 | 0.445181 | 0.445181 |
| 3 | 0.117050 | 0.117050 |
| 4 | 0.425836 | 0.425836 |
| 6 | 0.029109 | 0.029109 |
| 8 | 0.554357 | 0.554357 |

Seven-seed mean: 0.238604 -> 0.290608; two gains, five ties.
Fresh parent runs on seeds 0 and 1 reproduced the reference scores, turns and
depths exactly. Additional validation seeds 3, 4, 8 matched the parent.
Full 15-seed mean was not remeasured. Package compilation and real arena
execution passed.

An initial projectile-overshoot guard was rejected and completely reverted:
on seeds 0, 1, 6, 2 it tied three scores and regressed seed 2 from 0.445181
to 0.179100. It is not part of the retained change.
