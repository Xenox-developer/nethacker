## Whole-peer baselines

These exact peer commits were evaluated locally on the same 15 public games. A high Private score need not beat this bot on the public batch.

## Reviewed experiment notes

Reviewed 27 September 2026. These notes summarize completed attempts through 10;
the automatically generated history table is authoritative for newer decisions.
This is experiment context, not a required new mutation or a measured gain.

## Keep the successful mechanism narrow

Attempt 10 additionally enabled the existing projectile guard against a gas
spore with a visible pet in its clipped 3x3 neighborhood, independently of
HAZARD_FIXES. Full Public: 0.3013431297 parent to 0.3081941584 candidate
(+0.0068510287), three gains (0/1/8), two losses (7/9), ten ties. The fresh
1027–1029 validation tied at 0.2297637148; promotion passed. Preserve this
guard along with the earlier sacrifice fix below. The proposed benefit is
avoiding pet blast deaths/alignment loss, but saved endpoint results do not
directly measure that causal chain. The small-sample gains on 0/1 persisted;
the broader batch reduced the net benefit substantially. A rerun of the parent
on 0/1 reproduced its reference scores, turns and depths.

Do not generalize the result to remembered pets, peaceful monsters, wand
behavior, or enabling all HAZARD_FIXES. A separate projectile overshoot/bystander
guard was tested first and reverted: 0/1/6 tied in score, but seed 2 fell from
0.445181 to 0.179100. Keep that failed mechanism distinct from the accepted
gas-spore projectile guard.

Attempt 7 added only a `GlobalLogic.can_sacrify()` guard against cockatrice and
chickatrice corpse selection without gloves. Full Public: 0.2597258454 parent
to 0.2861614452 candidate, two improvements and thirteen score ties. Fresh three
games tied at 0.4086152658, so the candidate was promoted. Preserve this guard.
It prevents a deliberate sacrifice pickup route; it is not general protection
against live petrifying monsters or every floor inspection.

## Preliminary failures omitted from the short history table

These changes were tested and reverted. Revisit only with a materially different
mechanism supported by new evidence, not merely a different favorable subset.

- Unconditional early digging-tool retention showed no gain in attempts 5 and 6.
- Quiet recovery below 80% HP before diving was mixed and regressed several
  strong games (attempt 5). Broad passive-contact avoidance lost on the full
  Public batch (attempt 3).
- Blanket earlier dive thresholds were unreliable: XL9 lost on full15 in
  attempt 6 despite a good three-game sample. XL8 also regressed. Attempt 7's
  25,000-turn/XL8 exit gained on 3/7/13 but regressed 2/4/8; a 10,000-turn/XL5
  first-level exit also had a larger regression than its gain.
- Permitting injured Valkyries to melee cold-passive jellies/molds and treating
  every species of difficulty >=8 as dangerous regressed samples (attempt 7).
- Enabling existing Elbereth recovery during the tour initially helped seed 3
  but regressed strong games in the broader nine-game sample (attempt 7).
- Exact critical-HP prayer eligibility did not improve samples 0/3/6 and
  1/7/13 in attempt 7. Do not claim it is untested.
- Broad remembered-petrifying-corpse BFS exclusion lost on full15 (attempt 5).
  Skipping all floor inspection on those squares also regressed stronger games
  (attempt 7). Blind-only inspection suppression and a guard only on the
  inspection PICKUP fallback did not improve 7/2/12. These differ from the
  successful sacrifice-selector guard above.

## Tactical lookahead: implemented, no measured Public improvement

Attempt 8 completed the requested three-turn planner and published it, but
candidate and same-run parent both scored 0.2893345546. Every full15 per-game
result field matched except wall time. No fresh validation or promotion followed.
The saved 0.2861614452 champion score from another run is not the right control
for claiming this planner improved anything.

The model and adapter were unchanged from the supplied assets. The mutator fixed
two integration defects: production StatsLogger requires explicit registration
of lookahead_plan/lookahead_override/lookahead_unsupported, and the default
TACTICAL_LOOKAHEAD flag must precede JF_CFG environment overrides. The original
fake-logger fixture missed the first defect. Production logger plus real fight2
fixtures now demonstrate an override can execute on a constructed observation.

Saved arena results contain no planner counters or action traces. Actual-game
planning and override counts remain unverified. A sample depth change that did
not persist in full15 does not prove activation. Before interpreting a further
planner variant, obtain bounded direct activation/fallback/override diagnostics;
do not broaden its safety gates merely to manufacture activity. The model
estimates hidden HP/damage/energy rather than cloning exact future game states.

## Hunger prayer cooldown: sample gain did not generalize

Attempt 9 changed only the fainting hunger-prayer cooldown from 400 to 1,000
turns. Seeds 0/1/2/3/6/7/9 improved in aggregate from 0.2165201326 to
0.2863659629, but full15 regressed from 0.2981700203 to 0.2817352023
(-0.0164348180): four gains, five losses and six ties. Major losses on 7/8/11
outweighed gains on 0/5/6/9; seeds 8 and 11 were absent from the small sample.
The fully scored candidate was published, rejected locally and not validated.
Do not repeat an unconditional 1,000-turn fainting cooldown as an untested fix.
An unconditional 1,200-turn version had already regressed the seven-game
sample. Exact HP prayer eligibility and suppressing prayers after divine anger
again showed no score gain on 0/1/2/6 and were reverted. Any new prayer change
needs a distinct observed mechanism and a comparison including strong games.

## Evaluation discipline

Same-source reruns have varied. Inspected seed derivation uses secret,
evaluation ID and trajectory ID, not solution digest or EXPERIMENTS.md. The
cause of variation remains unproven. Compare with the same-run full Public
parent and retain fresh local validation. Small samples and death labels alone
do not establish causal improvement. Public publication and organizer Private
scores are separate from local champion promotion.

## Mattock use with a removable shield

Hypothesis: once the descent phase starts, a known removable shield should not
exclude a dwarvish mattock from tool retention, retrieval, and digging. Keep
both hands free while that is the available digging tool; prefer a pick-axe,
and keep the earlier leveling policy unchanged. Cursed/unknown shields still
block the mattock. The existing MIT license is retained.

particularly `Inventory.get_best_armorset` and `Agent.pick_for_digging`.
Adapted to this bot's descent phase and curse checks, rather than replacing
its routing or enabling early descent. Source recorded in the manifest.

All evaluations used `python -m nethackers.arena.run`, identity
`val-dwa-law-fem`, and `--evaluation-id local`, as foreground commands.
Candidate batches: [2,13,14], [4,7,10], and repeat [4,7]. Fresh parent: [4,7].

| Seed | Supplied parent | Fresh parent | Candidate | Candidate repeat |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 2 | 0.445181 | — | 0.445181 | — |
| 4 | 0.425836 | 0.425836 | 0.554357 | 0.554357 |
| 7 | 0.466376 | 0.646505 | 0.646505 | 0.466376 |
| 10 | 0.506761 | — | 0.506761 | — |
| 13 | 0.179100 | — | 0.179100 | — |
| 14 | 0.117050 | — | 0.117050 | — |

Seed 4 consistently improves from depth 23 (eel drowning) to depth 27
(killed by an ettin), with identical candidate turns across repeats. Seeds
2/10/13/14 exactly match supplied parent turns, depths, and scores. Seed 7
has two outcomes in BOTH parent and candidate runs; no gain is attributed
to the change there. The initial six-seed mean was 0.408159 versus supplied
parent 0.356717, but the seed 7 variation prevents treating all of that delta
as causal. Full 15-seed overall was not measured.

Validation: compileall, make_agent import/construction, targeted tool-selection
checks (pre-dive exclusion, removable shield, cursed/unknown shield exclusion,
and pick-axe preference), six completed game seeds and the repeats above.
Results: `mattock-eval.json`, `mattock-parent-eval.json`, and
`mattock-repeat-eval.json`. Retained for the repeatable seed 4 improvement.
